Line-by-Line Explanation of the Java Interest Calculator Program

1.  import java.util.Scanner;
    -   Imports the Scanner class so the program can read user input.
2.  public class InterestCalculator {
    -   Declares a public class named InterestCalculator.
3.  public static void main(String[] args) {
    -   The main method where program execution begins.
4.  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    -   Creates a Scanner object to read input from the keyboard.
5.  System.out.print(“Enter Principal Amount:”);
    -   Asks the user to enter the principal amount.
6.  double principal = input.nextDouble();
    -   Stores the entered principal amount as a double.
7.  System.out.print(“Enter Rate of Interest (%):”);
    -   Prompts the user to enter the interest rate.
8.  double rate = input.nextDouble();
    -   Stores the entered interest rate.
9.  System.out.print(“Enter Time (in years):”);
    -   Prompts the user to enter the time in years.
10. int time = input.nextInt();
    -   Stores the entered time as an integer.
11. double simpleInterest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
    -   Calculates simple interest using the formula SI = P × R × T /
        100.
12. double amount = principal * Math.pow((1 + rate / 100), time);
    -   Calculates final amount after compound interest using A = P(1 +
        R/100)^T.
13. double compoundInterest = amount - principal;
    -   Calculates compound interest by subtracting principal from
        amount.
14. System.out.println(“—– Results —–”);
    -   Prints a results header.
15. System.out.println(“Simple Interest:” + simpleInterest);
    -   Displays the simple interest value.
16. System.out.println(“Compound Interest:” + compoundInterest);
    -   Displays the compound interest value.
17. input.close();
    -   Closes the Scanner to free resources.
18. }
    -   Closes the main method.
19. }
    -   Closes the class.
